These files are the species used when BCP properties need to be matched to a reference. There is one species for each atom and hybridisation type (C sp3, C sp2, Si Sp3, Si sp2) etc that do not have lone pairs on the attached atom.

So, for example, if we were rotating CClFH to the defined coordinate system, the program will get the data to match with from SubH_CFHCH3_reor_wb97xd_aug-cc-pvtz
